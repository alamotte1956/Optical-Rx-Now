# Privacy Policy for Optical Rx Now

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Optical Rx Now is committed to protecting your privacy. This app is built with a **privacy-first, local-first architecture** that ensures your sensitive prescription data never leaves your device.

## Our Privacy Philosophy

**Your prescription data stays on YOUR device. Always.**

Unlike traditional health apps that store your data in the cloud, Optical Rx Now stores all prescription information, family member data, and personal health information locally on your device. We cannot access, view, or share this data because we simply don't have it.

## What Data We Collect

### Data Stored ONLY on Your Device (We Never See This)
- ✅ Eyeglass prescriptions
- ✅ Contact lens prescriptions
- ✅ Family member information
- ✅ Photos of prescriptions
- ✅ Prescription history
- ✅ Shopping preferences
- ✅ Any personal health information you enter

**This data is stored using your device's secure local storage and is never transmitted to our servers.**

### Data We Collect Anonymously
We collect minimal, anonymous analytics to improve the app:
- **Device Information:** Anonymous device ID (not linked to your identity)
- **Usage Metrics:** App opens, feature usage, clicks
- **Affiliate Link Clicks:** When you click on partner store links
- **Ad Interactions:** When ads are displayed or clicked (managed by Google AdMob)

**We DO NOT collect:**
- ❌ Your name, email, or contact information
- ❌ Your prescription data
- ❌ Your photos
- ❌ Your location (except temporarily when you search for nearby stores, and it's never stored)
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ Any protected health information (PHI)

## How We Use Data

### Anonymous Analytics
We use anonymous device IDs to:
- Count app opens and active users
- Measure which features are most used
- Track affiliate partner click-through rates
- Improve app performance and user experience

### Advertising (Google AdMob)
We display ads using Google AdMob to support free app development. AdMob may:
- Display personalized ads based on your interests (if you consent to tracking)
- Collect device identifiers for ad serving
- Track ad impressions and clicks

You can opt-out of personalized ads through your device settings:
- **iOS:** Settings > Privacy > Tracking
- **Android:** Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization

For more information, see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Affiliate Partnerships
When you click on affiliate partner links (e.g., to Sam's Club, LensCrafters, Warby Parker), we may:
- Track the click for commission attribution
- Receive a small commission if you make a purchase (at no extra cost to you)
- This helps keep the app free while supporting our operations

**We never share your prescription data with affiliate partners.**

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Device Storage
- All prescription data is encrypted using your device's built-in security
- Data is protected by your device's passcode/biometric authentication
- Backups are handled by your device's backup system (iCloud, Google Drive)
- We recommend enabling device encryption and regular backups

### Backend Server Data
Our servers store ONLY:
- Anonymous device IDs
- Aggregate usage statistics
- Affiliate partner information (read-only for users)
- Admin dashboard metrics

**No PHI or PII is stored on our servers.**

## Data Retention

### Local Device Data

- Delete prescriptions or family members anytime through the app
- Uninstalling the app removes all local data
- Device backups may retain data according to your device's backup settings

### Server Analytics Data
- Anonymous analytics are retained for 24 months
- Aggregate statistics may be retained indefinitely for business analysis
- No way to link analytics to individual users

## Your Rights

### Data Access
- **Local Data:** You have full access to all data stored on your device through the app
- **Analytics Data:** Because analytics are anonymous, we cannot identify or retrieve data about specific users

### Data Deletion

- **Analytics Data:** Contact us to request deletion of analytics associated with your device ID

### Data Portability
- Export prescriptions as PDF anytime through the app

3. **Affiliate Partners** - Various optical retailers (only receive anonymous click data)

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has used this app, please contact us.

## Compliance

- No hidden data collection
- No tracking beyond what's documented here
