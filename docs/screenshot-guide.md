## Tips for Great Screenshots

### Visual Appeal
1. **Use real UI:** Actual app screenshots look more authentic than mockups
2. **Show functionality:** Demonstrate features in action, not just static screens
3. **Highlight key features:** Use visual cues (arrows, highlights) sparingly
4. **Maintain consistency:** Same data, style, and quality across all screenshots
5. **Tell a story:** Screenshots should flow logically (setup → use → benefit)

### Technical Quality
1. **Retina/HD quality:** Always use highest resolution available
2. **Proper orientation:** Portrait for phone apps (landscape if app supports it)
3. **Clean backgrounds:** Remove distractions from screenshots
4. **Proper lighting:** Bright, clear, well-lit UI
5. **Color accuracy:** Ensure colors match actual app

### Marketing Impact
1. **Lead with benefit:** First screenshot should show main value proposition
2. **Feature variety:** Show different aspects of app (don't repeat screens)
3. **Privacy emphasis:** At least one screenshot highlighting privacy/security
4. **User perspective:** Show what users will actually see and do
5. **Call to action:** Overlay text should encourage download

❌ **Showing outdated UI:** Screenshots must match current app version
❌ **Platform mixing:** Don't show iOS UI in Android screenshots
❌ **Misleading features:** Don't show features that don't exist
❌ **Personal data:** Never include real prescription data or personal information
❌ **Inappropriate content:** Keep it professional and age-appropriate
