- **Length:** Keep text short (5-7 words maximum)
- **Consistency:** Use same font, color, and style across all screenshots

### Optional Elements

- Feature icons or emoji (📸, 🔒, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦)
- Gradient overlays behind text
- Device frames (iPhone/Android bezels)
- Background colors matching app theme

### What to Avoid
- Too much text (cluttered)
- Low contrast (hard to read)
- Covering important UI elements
- Inconsistent styling
- Misleading information

## File Naming Convention

## Localization (Future Consideration)

If planning to support multiple languages:

- Translate overlay text
- Adapt sample data to local conventions
- Consider cultural differences in sample names/data

**For v1.0:** English-only screenshots

## Tips for Great Screenshots

### Visual Appeal
1. **Use real UI:** Actual app screenshots look more authentic than mockups
2. **Show functionality:** Demonstrate features in action, not just static screens
3. **Highlight key features:** Use visual cues (arrows, highlights) sparingly
4. **Maintain consistency:** Same data, style, and quality across all screenshots
5. **Tell a story:** Screenshots should flow logically (setup → use → benefit)

### Technical Quality
1. **Retina/HD quality:** Always use highest resolution available
2. **Proper orientation:** Portrait for phone apps (landscape if app supports it)
3. **Clean backgrounds:** Remove distractions from screenshots
4. **Proper lighting:** Bright, clear, well-lit UI
5. **Color accuracy:** Ensure colors match actual app

### Marketing Impact
1. **Lead with benefit:** First screenshot should show main value proposition
2. **Feature variety:** Show different aspects of app (don't repeat screens)
3. **Privacy emphasis:** At least one screenshot highlighting privacy/security
4. **User perspective:** Show what users will actually see and do
5. **Call to action:** Overlay text should encourage download

## Screenshot Testing

Before submission, verify:
- [ ] View screenshots on App Store/Play Store preview tool
- [ ] Check how screenshots appear as thumbnails
- [ ] Verify text is readable at small sizes
- [ ] Test on different device screen sizes
- [ ] Get feedback from others (clarity, appeal, accuracy)
- [ ] Ensure compliance with store guidelines

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Using low-resolution images:** Blurry screenshots get rejected
❌ **Too much text overlay:** Cluttered and hard to read
❌ **Showing outdated UI:** Screenshots must match current app version

❌ **Misleading features:** Don't show features that don't exist
❌ **Personal data:** Never include real prescription data or personal information
❌ **Inappropriate content:** Keep it professional and age-appropriate
