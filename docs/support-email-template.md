Dear Optical Rx Now User,

Thank you for contacting Optical Rx Now support! We have received your message and will respond within 48 business hours.

In the meantime, here are answers to some frequently asked questions:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

📱 Data Safety & Privacy

Q: Is my prescription data safe?
A: Yes! All your prescription data is stored locally on your device using military-grade AES-256 encryption. Your data NEVER leaves your device - no cloud storage, no servers, no data collection. Only you have access to your prescription information.

Q: What happens to my data if I uninstall the app?
A: All data is permanently deleted from your device when you uninstall the app. We do not store backups on any server. We recommend sharing/printing important prescriptions before uninstalling.

Q: Can my data be hacked or stolen?
A: Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to servers, the only security consideration is your device security. We recommend using a device passcode or biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

📸 Adding Prescriptions

Q: How do I add a prescription?
A: 
1. Tap "Add Family Member" to create a profile
2. Select the family member
3. Tap "Add Prescription"
4. Choose "Eyeglasses" or "Contact Lenses"
5. Either take a photo or manually enter prescription details
6. Tap "Save"

Q: Can I add prescriptions without photos?
A: Yes! You can manually enter all prescription details without taking or uploading a photo. Photos are optional and provided for your convenience.

Q: What if I make a mistake entering a prescription?
A: You can edit or delete prescriptions at any time. Simply open the prescription and use the edit or delete options.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

💾 Backup & Data Management

Q: How do I back up my prescriptions?
A: Since data is stored locally, backups are handled by your device's backup system:
- iOS: iCloud backup (if enabled) will back up app data
- Android: Google backup (if enabled) will back up app data

You can also manually save prescriptions by:
- Using the Share feature to email prescriptions to yourself
- Using the Print feature to save as PDF
- Taking screenshots of prescription details

Q: Can I transfer my data to a new phone?
A: If you restore your new phone from a backup (iCloud/Google), app data should transfer. Otherwise, we recommend sharing prescriptions to yourself via email before switching devices, then re-entering them on the new device.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔒 Age Verification

Q: Why do I need to verify my age?
A: The app stores medical information (optical prescriptions), and we require users to be 18+ to ensure they have the legal capacity to manage their own medical data and the medical data of their family members. This is a one-time verification.

Q: I accidentally selected the wrong option during age verification. How do I fix it?
A: If you selected "No" during age verification, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall the app to see the verification screen again. Your data will be lost during uninstallation since everything is stored locally.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

📷 Camera & Photo Permissions

Q: Why does the app need camera access?
A: Camera access is only used to take photos of your physical prescription documents. This is optional - you can manually enter prescription details without using the camera.

Q: Why does the app need photo library access?
A: Photo library access allows you to select existing prescription photos from your device. This is optional and only activated when you choose to add a photo from your library.

Q: Can I use the app without granting camera permissions?
A: Yes! You can manually enter all prescription information without using the camera. The app will work perfectly fine without camera access.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

📍 Location Permission

Q: Why does the app request location access?
A: Location access is used ONLY for the "Find Stores" feature to help you locate nearby optical retailers (like Sam's Club, LensCrafters, etc.). This is completely optional.

Q: Can I use the app without location access?
A: Absolutely! Location permission is only needed for the store finder feature. All prescription management features work without location access.

Q: Does the app track my location?
A: No. We do not track or store your location. When you use the store finder, your location is used momentarily to search for nearby stores and then immediately discarded.
