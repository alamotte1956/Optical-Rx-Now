Hello,

Thank you for contacting Optical Rx Now support!

We have received your message and will respond within 48 hours during business days (Monday-Friday).

In the meantime, here are answers to some frequently asked questions:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📱 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Q: Is my prescription data safe and private?
A: Yes! All your prescription data is stored ONLY on your device. We don't have servers, cloud storage, or any way to access your data. Your information never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it.

Q: How do I add a prescription?
A: 
1. First, add a family member by tapping "Add Family Member"
2. Select the family member
3. Tap "Add Prescription"
4. Choose prescription type (Eyeglass or Contact Lens)
5. Enter prescription details
6. Optionally add a photo by tapping the camera icon
7. Tap "Save"

Q: Can I backup my prescriptions?
A: Since all data is stored locally for privacy, there is no automatic cloud backup. To preserve your data:
- Keep your device backed up using iCloud (iOS) or Google Backup (Android)
- Export prescriptions by sharing them via email to yourself
- Take screenshots of important prescriptions

Q: Why does the app ask if I'm 18 years or older?
A: The app stores medical prescription information, which requires users to be 18 years or older. This is a one-time verification on first launch that ensures compliance with medical information privacy requirements.

Q: Why does the app need camera/photo permissions?
A: 
- Camera: To take photos of your prescription documents
- Photo Library: To select existing photos from your device
These permissions are only used when YOU choose to add a photo to a prescription. We never access your camera or photos without your explicit action.

Q: Why does the app ask for location permission?
A: Location is OPTIONAL and only used for the "Store Finder" feature to help you find nearby optical stores. The app works perfectly without location access - you can deny the permission and manually search by city or zip code.

Q: Can I use this app offline?
A: Yes! The app works 100% offline. All data is stored locally on your device. The only feature requiring internet is the Store Finder map.

Q: How do I delete my data?
A: You can:
- Delete individual prescriptions by swiping left on them
- Delete family members and all their prescriptions
- Completely remove all data by uninstalling the app

Q: Does this app replace my eye doctor?
A: No. Optical Rx Now is for storing and organizing prescription information only. It is NOT intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified eye care professional for medical concerns.

## Common Issue Resolutions

### Issue: "I can't add a prescription"
**Solution:** Make sure you've added a family member first. Prescriptions must be associated with a family member.

### Issue: "The app won't let me take a photo"
**Solution:** Check that camera permissions are enabled in device settings:
- iOS: Settings → Optical Rx Now → Camera → Enable
- Android: Settings → Apps → Optical Rx Now → Permissions → Camera → Allow

### Issue: "I deleted a prescription by accident"
**Solution:** Unfortunately, deleted prescriptions cannot be recovered due to our privacy-first design (no cloud backup). Consider sharing important prescriptions to email as a backup.

### Issue: "Store finder isn't working"
**Solution:** 
1. Check internet connection (map requires internet)
2. Enable location permissions if desired (optional)
3. Try manual search by entering city/zip code

### Issue: "How do I transfer my data to a new phone?"
**Solution:** Since data is stored locally:
- iOS: Restore from iCloud backup on new device
- Android: Restore from Google Backup on new device
- Manual: Share each prescription via email, then save to new device
